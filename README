This RSA recreation involves 3 scripts. RSA_RECIEVER is to be run first. It will generate the public key along with some more information and write this all to two files.
This first is "ReceiverOnly.txt," which is meant to represent information only accessible to the receiver. The second is "ReceiverToSender.txt," which is more easily
accessible by others. 

Then, the RSASENDER script is to be run, and it will require a "SenderToReceiver.txt" file. Lastly, the DECODED file is to be run. Messages must be short enough to be
encrypted fully and must be converted to ASCII prior to encryption.
